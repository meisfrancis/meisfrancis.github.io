# DevOps Best Practices for Small Teams

DevOps can seem daunting for small teams, but with the right approach, you can implement effective practices without overwhelming complexity.

## Start Small, Think Big

Begin with basic automation and gradually expand your DevOps practices:

### 1. Version Control
- Use Git with a clear branching strategy
- Implement code reviews for all changes
- Tag releases consistently

### 2. Continuous Integration
- Set up automated testing on every commit
- Use tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- Keep build times under 10 minutes

### 3. Deployment Automation
- Automate deployments to staging and production
- Use infrastructure as code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- Implement blue-green or rolling deployments

## Essential Tools for Small Teams

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or CircleCI
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Terraform, or AWS CDK
- **Monitoring**: Datadog, New Relic, or Prometheus
- **Communication**: Slack with automated notifications

## Conclusion

DevOps success for small teams comes from starting simple and iterating. Focus on automation that saves time and reduces errors.
