# Understanding Modern CSS: Grid and Flexbox

Modern CSS layout has evolved significantly with the introduction of Flexbox and CSS Grid. Understanding when and how to use each is crucial for effective web design.

## Flexbox: One-Dimensional Layouts

Flexbox excels at distributing space along a single axis (row or column):

### When to Use Flexbox
- Navigation bars
- Card layouts in a row
- Centering content
- Equal height columns

### Key Flexbox Properties
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

## CSS Grid: Two-Dimensional Layouts

Grid provides precise control over both rows and columns:

### When to Use Grid
- Complex page layouts
- Magazine-style designs
- Overlapping elements
- Responsive design with precise control

### Key Grid Properties
```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

## Combining Flexbox and Grid

The real power comes from using both together:
- Grid for overall page layout
- Flexbox for component-level layouts

## Conclusion

Master both Flexbox and Grid to create robust, maintainable layouts that work across all devices and screen sizes.
