    Yo! Those three words up there? Architecture, Reliability, and Study — they’re what I’m all about! I love how 
    they can mix together in different ways. In short, I’m focused on enhancing the reliability of architecture, and
    I’ve been at it for about four years now. It’s been a great journey, and I’m excited to keep exploring and learning!
